# Inventory App Project:
## JF 1.5
 - Can work effectively and contribute appropriately on a team to produce software
I demonstrated this job function in the inventory app project where me and two collogues created a basic inventory web resource. We got together listed the tasks adn delegated them efficiently making sure they all were completed correctly and swiftly

## JF 2.1
 - Can create and analyze artefacts, such as use cases and/or user stories
I also demonstrated this job function during the project by when listing our tasks copying them into issues and formatting them into proper user stories for us to divide and conquer.

# Back End Project:
## JF 3.3
 - Can link code to data sets
My back end project(the d-n-d-api) used a relational database to manage the data of D&D monsters, linking it to a sql database

## JF 3.6
- Can implement a RESTful API
This database was also RESTful allowing one to access and manage the database efficiently through its routes and provided http CRUD methods.

# Front End/Deployment Project:
## JF 2.5
 - Can implement a responsive User Interface

## JF 5.5
 - Understands and can apply structured techniques to problem solving, can debug code and can understand the structure of programmes to identify and resolve issues

My front-end and deployment project displayed a reactive and therefore responsive UI that allowed people to beautifully view an array of free video games. Though during development I ran into issues with a deprecated feature that gave undesirable results, though I was able to read the documentation and debug this issue swiftly and accurately.
