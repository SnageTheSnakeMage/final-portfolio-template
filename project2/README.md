    - Action:
        - After designing and deciding what I could and could not get done I built the entire project up in my spare time. It was hard due to not having as many resources as my peers due to kotlin bieng relatively new.

            - The project was completed in a less than timely manner but made the required expectations
        - Evaluation
            - The Project had no visuals and had to be interacted with a program like postman, but overall the back-end part was fully done and routed!
        - Lessons Learned
            - Time management is a major weakness of mine and can be improved and worked upon
